# Usage

If you want to build own majordomo docker container then read about required parameters and build steps [there](docker/README.md).

To run majordomo website from prebuilt image you can in 3 simple steps. Find details [there](docker-compose/README.md).
IMPORTANT! Container requires ready for use database. For some reasons i use standard mysql server instead of docker container. [There](Create-DB.md) short manual how to create user and database.
